# HomeSystemManagment
An assortment of scripts and tools I have written to help with my system management.

Currently working on a bash tool that will allow the user to catelog their hard drives.

Also this project is a way for me to learn how to use bash and git.

# What to Branches Doin'?
  ## DataImporting
    Frankly I have no clue what this is...
    I'm pretty sure, from the 0.5 ms that I looked at it, that this branch is for making scripts to import hard drive data from an external
    file and parse it to something usable for my dashboard.
  ## remote-management
    This will allow for remote management with relative ease.
